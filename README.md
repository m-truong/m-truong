## About Me:

I'm a recent graduate of General Assembly‚Äôs Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp with a non-traditional coding background in education and volunteer work. As a former associate teacher, it was very meaningful to be able to mentor and inspire young students to grow into curious, independent thinkers. My students knew me to be a humble, empathetic, patient, and selfless educator. 

In August of 2019, I was introduced to coding through my brother, and I began my journey into programming using online free resources like KhanAcademy, Codecademy, and freeCodeCamp. I was naturally drawn to programming because I am mathematically oriented and love problem-solving. One of my favorite hobbies is playing video games, so needless to say, the gamer in me loved the process of leveling up my coding skills, experimenting, and the creative thought process.

Even though I never truly had dreams of becoming a teacher, I have a desire to help others in profound ways. What did stick with me from my teaching experience was my interest in social impact and finding solutions to real-world problems. My experiences in education have fostered in me a desire to work at the intersection of education and technology. 

I'm currently applying the skills I gained from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp to continue to build projects and search for career opportunities.

In my free time, I play tennis üéæ, run outdoors üèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, and enjoy playing video games üïπ.
